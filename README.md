# DevUp

DevUp is for the creative, and curious, looking to build up their dev portfolios.

Motivation
There are many Non-Profit organizations who are in need of some level of application Development support, but donâ€™t have the resources to hire or support their own staff of Software Engineers. Many of these companies use Pro-Bono opportunities as a means to solicit Software experts to accomplish their IT needs. The DevUp application bridges the gap between aspiring Developers looking for opportunities to level-up (or, DevUp) their skills, and companies offering Pro-Bono opportunities, and open source projects, which developers can use to improve their professional portfolios. These opportunities can serve as great experience and an opportunity for recent College and Bootcamp grads to solve real business problems while growing their professional portfolios.
